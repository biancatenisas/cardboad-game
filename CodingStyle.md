## Layout Conventions

1. Write one statement per line.
2. Write one declaration per line.
3. Tab (set as 4 spaces) indentation.
4. Add at least one blank line between definitions.
5. Parantheses in expression to make expressions apparent.

```
    if ((val1 > val2) && (val1 > val3))
    {
        // Take appropriate action.
    }
 ```

## Commenting Conventions

1. Place the comment on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code.
2. Begin comment text with an uppercase letter.
3. End comment text with a period.
4. Insert one space between the comment delimiter (//) and the comment text,<br> 
as shown in the following example.


```
   // The following declaration creates a query. It does not run
   // the query.
```
